# Calendar
Calendar Application that can store user appointments which are kept in a csv file.

# Startup

At the start of the program the view is of the current month with the current day highlighted with a red circle. This is based off the local machine time. At the top there is a navigation with four buttons. The left arrow allows you to navigate to previous months and the right arrow allow you to move to future months. The today button will return you to the current month and the year button will display the entire year view.

# Setting up appointments

Appointments can be made by simply clicking on a date within the current month. This then prompts a pop up to display allowing you to set a title for your appointment and also set a time for the appointment.
